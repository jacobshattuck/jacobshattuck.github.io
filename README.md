# Engineering Leader

## GoDaddy

### Senior Software Engineer, Architecture & CICD

Designing and implementing how dev teams will launch their apps on AWS, specifically how we plan to launch apps which require a multi-region architecture.

### Manager of Software Development, Account Management

For three years I got to lead what is internally referred to as the MYA team (*My A*ccount).

### Senior Software Engineer, Products

I was actually originally hired to write JavaScript, but had CICD knowledge from my time at Sony which ended up being very useful for our team. I ended up implementing a CICD pipeline responsible for deploying multiple applications. These applications also happen to be GoDaddy's most critical applications and account for ~29% of company revenue.
